# Mobile Chat Port — High-Level Design

## What it does

Brings the Onyx chat experience to the native mobile app: a user opens the app, picks an agent (or uses the default), and has a streaming conversation grounded in the company's knowledge — optionally inside a project, optionally with documents/photos attached to a message. It mirrors the web product's behavior and talks to the **same backend, unchanged**; only the client is new.

## How it works (end-to-end walkthrough)

The mobile app already boots through `AuthGate` into an authenticated shell with a working sidebar and an `apiFetch` HTTP layer that injects the user's bearer token and resolves the server URL. We add an authed **chat route group** beside the existing `(auth)` group.

When the user sends a message, a **mobile orchestration hook** does three things: (1) if there's no chat session yet, it creates one on the backend (`POST /api/chat/create-chat-session`) carrying the selected agent's `persona_id` and the active `project_id`; (2) it optimistically drops a user bubble and an empty assistant bubble into an in-memory **message tree**; (3) it opens the streaming request.

The stream is the heart of it. We POST the message to `/api/chat/send-chat-message` using **`expo/fetch`** (the only HTTP call in the app that doesn't go through `apiFetch`, because it needs a readable byte stream). The backend replies with **newline-delimited JSON** — one packet per line. A **shared pure parser** (the same line-buffering logic the web app uses, lifted into `@onyx-ai/shared`) turns the byte chunks into typed packet objects. The mobile hook reads those packets, ignores heartbeats, and — for the core experience — only cares about the message text packets (`MESSAGE_START/DELTA/END`) plus `STOP`/`ERROR`. It appends streamed text onto the assistant bubble, flushing updates to the UI in ~50ms batches so the screen doesn't thrash.

The chat screen renders the message tree with **FlashList v2** (non-inverted, auto-pinned to the bottom while streaming). The streaming assistant bubble renders its accumulating text through a **React Native markdown component**. When the `STOP` packet arrives, the conversation returns to idle and the assistant bubble gets its real server message-id.

Reopening a past chat fetches its history from the backend and rebuilds the message tree with the **same shared `processRawChatHistory` helper** the web uses. Listing chats, agents, and projects all go through **TanStack Query** (already wired and persisted to MMKV), keyed by server URL so switching backends never serves stale data.

Agents, projects, and attachments layer on top of this core without changing it: agent selection just sets the `persona_id` used at session-create time; projects set the `project_id`; attachments upload files (via `expo-file-system`'s streaming upload task) and attach their `file_descriptors[]` to the send request, gating the send button until the files finish indexing.

## Key components

- **`(app)` route group** — authed chat screens (new-chat, `chat/[id]`, history, projects). (new, mobile)
- **`useChatController` / `useChatSessionController`** — mobile orchestration: submit, drive the stream, batch flushes, stop, load/resume history. (new, mobile)
- **`chatSessionStore` (zustand)** — ephemeral per-session state: message tree, chat state, abort controller. **Not persisted.** (new, mobile)
- **expo/fetch stream wrapper** — the one streaming HTTP call; feeds bytes into the shared parser. (new, mobile)
- **TanStack Query hooks** — sessions, agents, projects, files lists (persisted, keyed by server URL). (new, mobile)
- **RN UI** — `MessageList` (FlashList v2), `StreamingMarkdown`, `InputBar` (keyboard-sticky), agent picker, project screens, attachment chips. (new, mobile)
- **`@onyx-ai/shared` contracts + pure helpers** — types + NDJSON parser + message-tree math + history rebuild + file-descriptor helper. (new in shared; web re-points to them per phase)

## End-to-end scenario

1. User opens the app → `AuthGate` lands them in the `(app)` chat home; sidebar shows their recent chats (TanStack Query over the sessions list).
2. User taps an agent in a picker → selection stored; starter prompts shown on the empty chat screen.
3. User types "Summarize the Q3 board deck" and taps send.
4. `useChatController` creates a session (`persona_id` = chosen agent) → gets `chat_session_id`, navigates to `chat/[id]`.
5. It drops a user bubble + empty assistant bubble into the message tree (`chatState='loading'`).
6. It POSTs the message via `expo/fetch`; the backend streams NDJSON packets.
7. The shared parser yields packets; the hook appends `MESSAGE_DELTA` text to the assistant bubble, flushing every ~50ms (`chatState='streaming'`).
8. FlashList keeps the view pinned to the bottom; the assistant bubble renders markdown as it grows.
9. `STOP` arrives → `chatState='input'`, assistant bubble gets its server message-id, sessions list refetches so history reflects the new turn.
10. User backgrounds the app mid-answer and returns → reopening the session replays buffered packets and re-attaches to the live run.

## Sequence of key operations

1. Resolve auth + server URL (existing `AuthGate` / `sessionManager`).
2. Create chat session if none (`persona_id`, `project_id`) → `chat_session_id`.
3. Optimistically seed the message tree (user + empty assistant nodes).
4. Open `expo/fetch` POST stream with bearer + JSON body.
5. Decode bytes → shared NDJSON parser → typed packets; drop heartbeats.
6. Reduce `MESSAGE_*` packets into the assistant node; batch-flush to zustand (~50ms).
7. On `STOP`/`ERROR`/abort: settle chat state, release the reader, capture message-id, refetch sessions.
8. Reopen/resume: fetch history → shared `processRawChatHistory` → tree; if a run is live, tail `resume-stream`.

## Key decisions & why

- **`expo/fetch` for streaming, `apiFetch` for everything else** — RN's legacy fetch has no readable body; `expo/fetch` (SDK 56 default) exposes `response.body.getReader()`, letting us reuse the web's exact NDJSON parsing. JSON list calls stay on the existing `apiFetch` choke-point (bearer + error normalization).
- **Share the parser + tree math, not the reducer** — the NDJSON framing and tree semantics are identical-by-construction across clients (same backend), so sharing them prevents silent drift at near-zero cost; the packet→display reducer is React-coupled and trivial for the core, so it stays mobile-owned. (This is Approach C, honoring the extract-on-proven-reuse policy.)
- **Two-tier state: TanStack Query for lists, zustand for the live stream** — lists benefit from the existing MMKV persistence + refetch; the streaming tree holds an `AbortController` and must *not* be persisted, so it lives in a separate, ephemeral zustand store.
- **FlashList v2 non-inverted with `maintainVisibleContentPosition`** — the modern v2 pattern for chat; pins to the bottom while streaming without yanking a user who scrolled up.

## What existing behavior changes

- **Mobile**: net-new feature; nothing pre-existing is removed.
- **Web**: behavior unchanged. Some web files have their *imports re-pointed* to the now-shared pure helpers (mechanical, verified by web's own tests), only in the phase that extracts each helper — never a forced rewrite.
- **Backend**: no changes.
