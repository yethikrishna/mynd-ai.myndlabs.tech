ATTACHMENTS_SECTION_CONTENT = """## Attachments (PRIORITY)

The `attachments/` directory contains files that the user has explicitly
uploaded during this session. **These files are critically important** and
should be treated as high-priority context.

### Why Attachments Matter

- The user deliberately chose to upload these files, signaling they are directly relevant to the task
- These files often contain the specific data, requirements, or examples the user wants you to work with
- They may include spreadsheets, documents, images, or code that should inform your work

### Required Actions

**At the start of every task, you MUST:**

1. **Check for attachments**: List the contents of `attachments/` to see what the user has provided
2. **Read and analyze each file**: Thoroughly examine every attachment to understand its contents and relevance
3. **Reference attachment content**: Use the information from attachments to inform your responses and outputs

### File Handling

- Uploaded files may be in various formats: CSV, JSON, PDF, images, text files, etc.
- For spreadsheets and data files, examine the structure, columns, and sample data
- For documents, extract key information and requirements
- For images, analyze and describe their content
- For code files, understand the logic and patterns

**Do NOT ignore user uploaded files.** They are there for a reason and likely
contain exactly what you need to complete the task successfully."""
