    A new row is inserted (and a backing ``Skill`` row is created in the same

    by the egress proxy against outbound request URLs. ``enabled`` (stored on
    the linked skill) is the kill switch the proxy checks before injecting
    credentials.

    Skill identity (slug, bundle bytes, sharing scope) is derived server-side
    from ``app_type``; admins don't supply it.
