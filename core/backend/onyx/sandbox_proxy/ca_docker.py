"""Docker-compose implementation of the CA persistence layer.

A shared compose-named volume is the source of truth: the proxy mounts it
read-write so it can persist on cold start; every sandbox container mounts it
read-only so ``firewall-init.sh`` can install ``ca.crt`` into the trust store.
That mount also makes ``ca.key`` present in Docker sandbox filesystems; the
key is protected by ``0600`` root ownership, and the sandbox agent runs as
UID 1000 after ``firewall-init.sh`` finishes.

Concurrent-persist arbitration: the shipped compose deployment runs exactly one
``sandbox-proxy`` replica, so the cold-start race is not a routine concern in
docker mode. ``persist`` still rendezvouses on ``O_EXCL`` against ``ca.crt`` for
two reasons:

1. Defense against an operator running ``docker compose up --scale
   sandbox-proxy=2``. Without ``O_EXCL`` both replicas would race-overwrite each
   other's key, leaving sandbox trust stores pointing at a cert whose private
   key the proxy doesn't have.
2. Contract parity with ``K8sSecretCAStore``, which uses a 409 Conflict on
   conditional Secret create for the same rendezvous so
   ``CABootstrap.ensure_ca`` stays backend-agnostic.

The loser raises ``CAStoreConflictError`` and ``CABootstrap.ensure_ca`` falls
into the reload-the-winner branch.

Crash recovery: a crash between writing ``ca.crt`` and writing ``ca.key`` leaves
the cert without a key. The next boot's ``load()`` raises rather than silently
regenerating (which would invalidate trust stores already populated from the
orphaned cert). Operator recovery is: delete ``ca.crt``, restart proxy.
