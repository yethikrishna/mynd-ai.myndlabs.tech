_COUNTER_TTL_SECONDS = 15 * 24 * 3600  # 15 days

# Why Lua scripts for decrements:
#
# Redis executes each individual command atomically, but two separate commands
# (e.g. GET then DECR) from different clients can interleave. With multiple
# concurrent docprocessing workers, two workers finishing batches at the same
# time could both read the same counter value and both decrement, causing one
# decrement to be silently lost. Lost decrements leave in_flight overcounted,
# which would cause the monitor to incorrectly detect a worker crash.
#
# Lua scripts run single-threaded on the Redis server — no other client command
# can interleave while a script is executing. This serializes the GET+DECR into
# one uninterruptible unit, preventing lost decrements. Note that Lua does NOT
# provide rollback (unlike a DB transaction); if the script errors mid-way,
# partial writes persist. That is acceptable here since counters are soft
# signals and the monitor tolerates minor imprecision.
#
# Plain Python INCR is used for incr_pending since concurrent increments cannot
# lose updates — each adds 1 regardless of ordering.

# Atomically move one batch from pending → in_flight.
# The if-guard prevents pending from going negative if cleanup() races with a
# late task_prerun signal. Serialized execution on the Redis server prevents
# lost decrements when multiple workers pick up batches concurrently.
# KEYS[1]=pending, KEYS[2]=in_flight, ARGV[1]=ttl_seconds
