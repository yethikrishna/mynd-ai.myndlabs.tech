"""Stage taxonomy for `IndexAttempt` metrics.

This module owns the canonical pipeline-stage enum, its display-scope
companion enum, and the static mapping between them. It is intentionally
a leaf module — it imports nothing from the rest of the Onyx codebase —
so it can be safely imported by both ``onyx.db.models`` (which needs the
enum as a column type on ``IndexAttemptStageMetric``) and
``onyx.db.index_attempt_metrics`` (which uses the taxonomy when writing
stage timing aggregates) without creating a circular import.

The ordering of `IndexAttemptStage` members is intentional and represents
the natural temporal order of the pipeline (docfetching first, then
docprocessing). Both the API ordering and the frontend "Pipeline order"
sort rely on this ordering, so do not reorder members without updating
those consumers.
