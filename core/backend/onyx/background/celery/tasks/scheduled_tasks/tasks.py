"""Celery tasks for Craft Scheduled Tasks.

Three @shared_task wrappers, split across two queues:

- ``dispatch_due_scheduled_tasks`` (primary queue, per tenant, every
  30 s): claims due rows via ``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``, advances
  ``next_run_at``, writes either a QUEUED run row (and enqueues the
  executor onto ``scheduled_tasks``) or a SKIPPED row (when a prior run
  is still in flight). Lightweight DB-only work, so it lives on primary
  rather than competing with long-running executor slots.
- ``run_scheduled_task(run_id)`` (``scheduled_tasks`` queue): thin
  delegation to ``run_scheduled_task_logic`` in the executor module.
  The dedicated worker exists for this task.
- ``cleanup_stuck_scheduled_runs`` (primary queue, hourly): marks runs
  that have been QUEUED >15 min or RUNNING >45 min as
  ``failed (stuck)``.

Per CLAUDE.md:

- All tasks use ``@shared_task`` (never ``@celery_app.task``).
- Every enqueue passes ``expires=`` so a dead consumer can't grow the
  backlog without bound.
- Time limits are implemented inside the task body (the executor's
  budget). Celery's thread-pool worker pool silently ignores
  ``soft_time_limit`` and ``time_limit``.
