"""Live behavior test for Ollama streaming through LiteLLM.

`_patch_ollama_chunk_parser` (in `monkey_patches.py`) ensures reasoning
tokens are routed to `Delta.reasoning_content` and visible answer tokens
land on `Delta.content`, for both native `thinking` field chunks and
legacy `<think>...</think>`-tagged content chunks. Unit tests in
`backend/tests/unit/onyx/llm/test_litellm_monkey_patches.py` cover the
state machine against crafted chunk dicts; this test exercises the same
path against Ollama Cloud's live wire format so we catch upstream
protocol drift.

    """A thinking-capable Ollama model must stream its chain-of-thought on
    `Delta.reasoning_content` and its final answer on `Delta.content`, and
    every thinking chunk must surface (not just the first two). A single
    chunk may legitimately carry both fields — Ollama emits transition
    chunks with both `thinking` and `content` populated, and the patch
    routes them to their respective Delta fields rather than dropping
    either.

    Without `_patch_ollama_chunk_parser`, LiteLLM's Ollama transformer
    silently drops reasoning_content from the third chunk onwards
    (transformation.py:504-510 only branches for the first two thinking
    chunks). This test guards against regression in either the patch or
