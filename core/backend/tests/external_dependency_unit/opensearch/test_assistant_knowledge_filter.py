"""Tests for OpenSearch assistant knowledge filter construction.

These tests verify that when an assistant (persona) has knowledge attached,
the search filter includes the appropriate scope filters with OR logic (not AND),
ensuring documents are discoverable across knowledge types like attached documents,
hierarchy nodes, document sets, and persona/project user files.
