"""External-app vs skill-endpoint boundary.

External-app-backed skills are managed via the external-apps API; the
skills API never lists or mutates them. The sandbox-injection path is
*different* — it includes the authenticated external-app skills the
user has connected, so the agent's workspace gets the right files.

Two contracts under test:

1. The skills endpoint (``list_skills_for_user`` / ``fetch_skill_for_user``
   / ``fetch_skill_for_user_by_slug``) **never** returns an external-app
   skill, regardless of whether the user has authenticated for it.
2. The sandbox-injection path (``list_skills_for_sandbox_injection``)
   includes external-app skills the user has authenticated for and
   excludes the ones they haven't.

Regular skills (no backing ``ExternalApp`` row) are unaffected by
either filter and remain subject only to the existing ``enabled`` +
sharing-scope rules.
