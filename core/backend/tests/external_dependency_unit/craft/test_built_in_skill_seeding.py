"""Tests for built-in skill *row* behavior.

The ``skill`` rows for built-ins are seeded by the
``skill_built_in_id_discriminator`` migration — migrations are the source
of truth and there is no boot-time seeder. These tests cover the runtime
behaviors that depend on those rows plus the codified ``BUILT_IN_SKILLS``:
availability gating, admin-immutability, the non-unique
``built_in_skill_id``, and the XOR schema invariant. Rows are inserted
directly via ``make_built_in_skill_row`` so each test is self-contained
and order-independent."""
