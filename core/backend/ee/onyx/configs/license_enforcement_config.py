"""Constants for license enforcement and per-feature tier gating.

Two related concerns live here, both consumed by the `tier_gate` middleware:

1. `LICENSE_ENFORCEMENT_ALLOWED_PREFIXES` — paths that bypass license
   enforcement entirely (auth, billing, health checks, etc.).
2. `PATH_PREFIX_MIN_TIER` — minimum tier required to access a given path
   prefix. `Tier.BUSINESS` = Business+. `Tier.ENTERPRISE` = Enterprise only.
   Longest-prefix-wins, so a nested path can resolve to a stricter tier
   than its parent (e.g. `/admin/enterprise-settings/scim` is ENTERPRISE
   even though `/admin/enterprise-settings` is BUSINESS).

Import these constants in both production code and tests to ensure
consistency.

Multi-tenant cloud gating lives in `multi_tenant_gating_config.py` and is
deliberately separate — cloud uses subscriptions, not licenses.

# Paths that are ALWAYS accessible, even when license is expired/gated.
# These enable users to:
#   /auth - Log in/out (users can't fix billing if locked out of auth)
#   /license - Fetch, upload, or check license status
#   /health - Health checks for load balancers/orchestrators
#   /me - Basic user info needed for UI rendering
#   /settings, /enterprise-settings - View app status and branding
#   /billing - Unified billing API
#   /proxy - Self-hosted proxy endpoints (have own license-based auth)
#   /tenants/billing-* - Legacy billing endpoints (backwards compatibility)
#   /manage/users, /users - User management (needed for seat limit resolution)
#   /notifications - Needed for UI to load properly
